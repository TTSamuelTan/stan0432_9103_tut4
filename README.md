# **Imaging Technique Inspiration**

## Technique
***Double (or Multiple) exposure*** is a photographic technique that superimposes two different images onto one frame. This technique can be used to mix and contrast concepts, themes, or visual effects, often resulting in surreal and dreamlike images.
## Incorporate aspect
By using ***Double exposure***, I wanted to mix two very different images to create a coherent story or message. Considering the demand for innovation and creativity in assignments, this technique opens up the possibility for unique narratives that have deep emotional resonance.

# **Coding Technique Exploration**

## Technique
In order to implement the double-exposure image I mentioned earlier by way of code, I found a coding technique called ***Mix-blend-mode***.

## How it works
The CSS blending modes can seamlessly blend multiple images using classes such as *multiply*, *overlay* or *screen*, especially in combination with opacity and blending method to digitally reproduce double exposure effects.


This technique provides a real-time, dynamic visual experience for web design that can be updated in real-time based on the rendering of the page.
